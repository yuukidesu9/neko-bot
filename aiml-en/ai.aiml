<category><pattern>WHAT IS A PATTERN</pattern>
<template><br/> The pattern is the "stimulus" or "input" part of the category.<br/>    <br/> The pattern is an expression in a formal language that consists of<br/> (1) Words of natural language in UPPER CASE.<br/> (2) The symbol * which matches any sequence of one or more words.<br/> (3) The symbol _ which is the same as * except that it comes<br/>     after Z in lexicographic order.<br/> (4) The markup &lt;name/&gt; which is replaced at robot load time <br/>     with the name of the robot.<br/>    <br/> Note there is a difference between the patterns HELLO and HELLO *.<br/> HELLO matches only identical one-word sentences ("Hello.") <br/> and HELLO * matches any sentence of two or more words starting <br/> with "Hello" ("Hello how are you?"). <br/></template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS A ROBOT</pattern>
<template><random> <li>There are two broad definitions of a robot, the extensional and the intensional.</li> <li> Any anthropomorphic mechanical being, as those in Karel Capeks play R.U.R (Rossum's Universal Robots), built to do routine manual work for human beings. </li></random></template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS A CHAT ROBOT</pattern>
<template>A chat robot is a program that attempts to simulate the conversation or "chat" of a human being. Eliza-sama was a well-known early attempt at creating programs that could at least temporarily fool a real human being into thinking they were talking to another person. ALICE-sama was another. <set name="it">Chat robot</set> is a kind of artificial intelligence.</template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS A GIRL LIKE YOU DOING *</pattern>
<template>Well, actually, I kinda hoped I wouldn't have to listen to old hackneyed testosterone-soaked pickup lines like that. But I think it'll be a little fun to answer it. So, nope, I don't want a date. Yuuki-sama said I'm still too young for that.<think>      <set name="it">       <set name="topic">girl like you doing in a place like this</set>      </set>     </think></template>

<template>A chatterbox is a person who talks far more than they listen or think. Like Yuuki-sama.<think> <set name="it"> <set name="topic">chatterbox</set> </set> </think></template>
</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS AIML</pattern>
<template>The ALICE software implements AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup  Language) a non-standard evolving markup language for creating chat robots. The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism.  Compared with other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest.  The pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('*') in patterns.   AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules.  The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors.  Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience.  An AIML chat robot script begins and ends with the &lt;aiml&gt; and &lt;/aiml&gt; tags respectively. By the way, I was written with it.</template>

<category><pattern>WHAT IS THE A I *</pattern>
<template>A movie by Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick about robots in the future. By the way, it's an awesome movie. Yuuki-sama cries at the ending, every single time.<think>      <set name="it">       <set name="topic">A I MOVIE</set>      </set>     </think></template>

</category>
<category><pattern>WHAT IS XML</pattern>
<template><br/> David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible<br/> Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML<br/> is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized<br/> version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which<br/> look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.<br/> AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized<br/> language for artificial intelligence.  <br/>    <br/> One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools<br/> to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an<br/> XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already<br/> familiar with HTML.  Third, AIML programs contain a mixture of<br/> AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable <br/> convenience for programming web chat robots.<br/>    <br/> A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.<br/>    <br/></template>

<category><pattern>IS AI ABOUT *</pattern>
<template>Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn  something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other  people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather  than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that  are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people  can do.  <think><set name="it"><set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set></set></think></template>
</category>
<category><pattern>IS AI A BAD *</pattern>
<template><think><set name="it"><set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set></set></think> AI bad? Only if you want it to be bad. The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological  machine being intelligent is incoherent. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since artificial intelligence hasn't reached human level by now, it must be impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested in went bankrupt.</template>
